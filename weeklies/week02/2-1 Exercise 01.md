# Exercises 2.1 - #01
## For each of the following algorithms, indicate 
 * (i) a natural size metric for its inputs, 
 * (ii) its basic operation, and 
 * (iii) whether the basic operation count can be different for inputs of the same size:

| Algorithm | Natural Size Metric of Input | Basic Operation | Basic Operation Count Can Be Different than Input Size |
