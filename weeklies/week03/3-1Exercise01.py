# 
# a. Give an example of an algorithm that should not be 
# considered an application of the brute-force approach.
#
# A binary search is an example of an algorithm that should
# not be considered for a brute-force approach. This is
# because the binary search is used to find a single item
# that matches what you are looking for, where going through
# each element would be inefficient and unnecessary. 
#
# b. Give an example of a problem that cannot be solved
# by a brute-force algorithm.
#
# A problem that cannot be solved by a brute-force algorithm
# is one that solves for the next best set of moves for a 
# particular card or board game. This is not feasible because
# certain games have so many possible plays each move, and calculating
# the probability of each opponent's most likely moves means that
# the possibilities for a set of moves is incredibly exponential.
# This is possible for simpler games, but machine learning is necessary
# for the more complex games in order to cut down on computations.
