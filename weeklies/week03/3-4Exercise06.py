# Exercises 3.4 - #06
# 
# Odd pie fight - There are n>= 3 people positioned on a field (Euclidean plane)
# so that each has a unique nearest neighbor. Each person has a cream pie.
# At a signal, everbody hurls his or her pie at the nearest neighbor. Assuming
# that n is odd and that nobody can miss his or her target, true or false:
# There always remains at least one person not hit by a pie.
#
# True, no matter what there will always be at least one person not hit by a
# pie because the two people that have the smallest distance between them will
# hit each other, instead of hitting other people, which will throw off the
# possibility to hit everyone.
